                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>Fewer people are politically active while society is becoming more complex, so it is important to
                    have a
                    safe way to gather knowledge and information. Mathijs van Buesekom noted that the current GroenLinks
                    platform is closed and not accessible to regular members, which reduces transparency.In this
                    project, </p>

                <p> <strong> I am designing a safe process that is partly public and partly closed for inviting internal
                        members
                        and
                        external experts.</strong></p>

                <p> Based on research by Martijn Bosman, there is a need for a safe, transparent, and democratic process
                    that allows members and citizens to participate and contribute to political discussions.</p>
            </section>

                    <h2>ABOUT CLIENT🕴️</h2>
                    <p>Martijn Bosman is a lecturer at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and a service
                        designer.
                        He is a member of GroenLinks and has researched the internal decision-making processes of
                        political
                        parties. His research showed a lack of participation and communication. Martijn aims to make
                        political parties more democratic and transparent, and therefore proposes designing a safe
                        digital
                        interactive product to invite citizens and experts to participate in discussions within working
                        groups.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>
                        The current GroenLinks platform is closed, meaning regular members and citizens cannot access
                        key
                        information or discussions, which limits participation and transparency. This creates a gap
                        between
                        the party and its supporters. Martijn Bosman argues that a more transparent and democratic
                        process
                        is needed. To address this, an interactive digital product is needed that safely invites members
                        and
                        experts to participate in working groups.

                            <p>To better understand the needs and pain points of potential users, I conducted interviews
                                with
                                chairmen of working groups from different sectors who fit the target audience profile.
                                The
                                interviews focused on their
                                experiences with political platforms, their motivations for participation, and their
                                concerns
                                regarding security and transparency.Based on the insights gathered, I created a persona

                                To identify all relevant parties involved in the invite process, I created a stakeholder
                                map.
                                This map helped visualize the relationships and interests of each stakeholder, including

                                members, external experts, citizens, and platform administrators. Understanding these

                                was crucial for designing an inclusive and secure invite system that addresses the needs
                                of
                                all

                            These

                <h3> 0.2 IDEATION </h3>
                <p>Based on the research insights, I brainstormed various ideas for the invite system. I focused
                    on
                    creating a user-friendly interface that balances security with ease of use. I explored
                    different
                    methods for verifying identities, such as two-factor authentication and secure invitation
                    links.
                    Additionally, I considered features that would enhance transparency, such as activity logs
                    and
                    clear communication channels between members and invitees. After evaluating the ideas
                    against the
                    requirements specification, I selected the most promising concepts to develop further.</p>

                        security.
                        This involved asking "How can you..." questions to identify potential solutions and
                        innovations

                    <p>The process consists of multiple phases that invitees go through in order to participate in a
                        working
                        group. Throughout these steps, different privacy levels—public, open, private, and secret—are
                        taken
                        into account. This ensures that invitees only gain access to information relevant to their role,
                        while safeguarding the confidentiality of the content. As a result, the right people receive the
                        right information based on their access level.</p>

                            specific individuals or roles within the group, and secret content is only accessible to

                            invite
                            system. The wireframes focused on key screens, such as the invitation process, user
                            dashboard,
                            and security settings. I ensured that the design was intuitive and user-friendly, with clear
                            navigation and accessible features. The wireframes served as a foundation for further
                            development
                            and refinement </p>

                            <h4>The inviteflow using user story map</h4>
                            <p>To illustrate the user journey through the invite system, I created a user story map.
                                This
                                map
                                outlined the key steps and interactions that users would experience, from receiving an
                                invitation
                                to participating in a working group. The story map helped identify potential pain points
                                and
                                opportunities for improvement, allowing me to refine the design and ensure a seamless
                                user
                                experience.</p>

                        <p>To validate the effectiveness of the invite system, I conducted user testing sessions
                            with
                            potential users, including party members and external experts. Participants were
                            asked
                            to
                            complete specific tasks within the system, such as accepting an invitation,
                            verifying
                            their
                            identity, and accessing working group content. Feedback was collected on usability,
                            security
                            features, and overall user experience. Based on the feedback, I made necessary
                            adjustments to
                            improve the design and functionality of the invite system.</p>

                                design
                                and
                                validation process. The invite system successfully addressed key aspects such as
                                security
                                measures, user experience, transparency features, and inclusivity considerations.

                                from user testing indicated that the system was intuitive and easy to use, while also
                                providing the necessary security and transparency features. Overall, the project met

                    <h4>Societal Impact</h4>
                    <p>The invite system has the potential to significantly enhance political participation and
                        transparency within the GroenLinks party. By providing a secure and inclusive platform for
                        inviting members, experts, and citizens to participate in working groups, the system fosters
                        greater engagement and collaboration. This can lead to more diverse perspectives being
                        represented in political discussions, ultimately contributing to more democratic
                        decision-making
                        processes. Additionally, the emphasis on security and transparency helps build trust among
                        users,
                        encouraging more individuals to get involved in political activities.</p>

                        <li>I have learnt to proactively seek feedback from stakeholders and users throughout the

                            that the final product meets their needs and expectations.</li>
                        <li>I have learnt to not be afraid to fail and to embrace iterative design, using failures
                            as opportunities for learning and
                            improvement.</li>
                        <li>I have learnt to engage stakeholders early and often to ensure their needs and concerns
                            are
                            addressed in the design process.</li>
                        <li>I have learnt to master the courage to make design decisions based on research and user
                            feedback,
                            even when they challenge
