                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>This case study outlines the process and outcomes of redesigning the onboarding tutorial for
                    Ecochain's
                    Mobius software. The project aimed to enhance the user experience for new users by creating a
                    more
                    intuitive and engaging tutorial that effectively guides them through the initial steps of using
                    the
                    software.</p>

                <h2>ACOUNT CLIENTüï¥Ô∏è</h2>
                <p>Ecochain is a company specialized in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ‚Äî a method used to measure the
                    environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycleEcochain offers two LCA
                    software
                    solutions: Ecochain Mobius and Ecochain Helix.
                    The main difference between the two lies in their target users and applications:

                    Ecochain Mobius promotes ecodesign and is designed for product designers with limited knowledge
                    of
                    LCA.
                    It enables them to easily create LCAs and make more sustainable design choices early in the
                    development
                    process.

                    Ecochain Helix empowers companies to create LCAs at scale for their production facilities. It
                    provides
                    insights into environmental impacts at the company, process, and product level, supporting
                    strategic
                    sustainability decisions.</p>

                <h2>CHALLENGE ü¶æ</h2>
                <p>The existing onboarding tutorial within the Mobius software was intended to help guide users
                    through
                    the
                    process of creating a product. However, based on feedback from clients, the tutorial was
                    perceived
                    as
                    unclear, unhelpful, and lacking in practical guidance. Many users struggled to complete the
                    initial
                    steps and failed to understand the overall structure and capabilities of the software.</p>

                <h2>GOALüéØ</h2>
                <p>The primary goal of this project was to redesign the onboarding tutorial to enhance its clarity,
                    usefulness, and overall user experience. The aim was to create a more intuitive and engaging
                    tutorial
                    that would effectively guide users through the initial steps of using the Mobius software,
                    helping
                    them
                    understand its features and capabilities.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Conduct user research to gather feedback on the existing tutorial and identify pain points.
                    </li>
                    <li>Analyze user behavior and identify common challenges faced during the onboarding process.

                </ul>
                <p>By focusing on both usability and learning, this onboarding experience needed to support users
                    with
                    little to no LCA knowledge, empowering them to get value from the software right from the start.

                    everyone to understand. With this concept in mind, I created low-fidelity sketches and

                    the
                    flow to assess its effectiveness. Based on this review, I made adjustments to the flow and
                    then
                    presented it during a design review session. </p>
