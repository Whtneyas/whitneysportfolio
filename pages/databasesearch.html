                <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
                <p>Ecoinvent is one of the most comprehensive databases for environmental and life cycle data. It’s
                    widely used by sustainability professionals, researchers, and policy makers. However, many users
                    reported that finding the right dataset within Ecoinvent was time-consuming and confusing. The
                    database’s interface lacked intuitive search options, clear filters, and contextual guidance, making
                    it difficult to compare or understand results.

                    As part of this project, I set out to redesign the user experience of dataset discovery — helping
                    users navigate complex data structures more efficiently and confidently.</p>

                <h2>ABOUT CLIENT</h2>
                <p>Ecochain is a company specialized in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) — a method used to measure the
                    environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycleEcochain offers two LCA
                    software
                    solutions: Ecochain Mobius and Ecochain Helix.
                    The main difference between the two lies in their target users and applications:

                    Ecochain Mobius promotes ecodesign and is designed for product designers with limited knowledge
                    of
                    LCA.
                    It enables them to easily create LCAs and make more sustainable design choices early in the
                    development
                    process.

                    Ecochain Helix empowers companies to create LCAs at scale for their production facilities. It
                    provides
                    insights into environmental impacts at the company, process, and product level, supporting
                    strategic
                    sustainability decisions.</p>

                <h2>CHALLENGE 🦾</h2>
                The existing search function of the Ecoinvent database has been one of the biggest challenges for
                Ecohain. Its complex and unintuitive method for finding datasets prevents users from fully benefiting
                from the platform. This raises the question: How might we improve the dataset discovery experience
                within the Ecoinvent database to help users find relevant datasets more efficiently and confidently?

                <h2>GOAL🎯</h2>
                <p>To improve the usability and search experience of the Ecoinvent database by helping users efficiently
                    find relevant datasets for their sustainability analyses.</p>

                <h3>RESEARCH🔍</h3>
                    <p>Before starting this project, I conducted extensive research to understand the current
                    experience, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement: </p>

                <h3>Expert review</h3>
                <p> To understand the current state of the product, I performed an exploratory product analysis
                    using a heuristic evaluation. This allowed me to identify initial usability issues and form
                    assumptions for further user research.

            <section>
                <h3>Best practices/Design patterns</h3>
                <p> Before I began designing, I conducted a best-practices analysis. I examined how other websites
                    implement filters and where these filters are positioned on the page. I also looked at how they
                    allow users to compare products. For this research, I primarily analysed e-commerce platforms
                    such as bol.com, MediaMarkt, Tweakers, Coolblue, Amazon, and around ten additional e-commerce
                    websites. I also reviewed relevant articles on optimising websites through filtering and the
                    differences between using filters versus a search bar on a website..
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Competitor research</h3>
                <p> To gain insight into how competitors use filters in their software, I conducted a competitive
                    analysis by examining similar software products. I researched the following competitors, and the
                    insights I gathered were applied in my low-fidelity sketches.

                <ul>
                    <li>Picklr</li>
                    <li>One Click LCA</li>
                    <li>Earthster</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>PROPOSED SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>The solution provides a more precise search system, improves the <b>ordering of search results</b>
                    through the use of <b>filters</b>, and enables users to <b>compare datasets</b>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>FLOW DIAGRAM</h3>
                <p>From the Mobius articles I read and the tutorials I watched, I identified a large number of
                    filters and visualised them in a flow diagram. I also examined the database to see which filters
                    are available and how they can be applied. I analysed this information by entering a product and
                    then reviewing the results. For example, when I entered “transport,” I saw several categories of
                    trucks, such as “small size,” “medium size,” and “large size.” Based on this, I concluded that
                    multiple types of trucks exist, and I incorporated this conclusion into a filter in the system.

            <h3>LOW-FIDELITY & & ITERATIVE SKETCH ✏️</h3>
            <p>Based on the research conducted, I created low-fidelity sketches to visualize the concept of an
                improved search function for the Ecoinvent database. These sketches served as a foundation for
                further development and refinement of the design. </p>

        <section>
            <h3>HIFI-DELITY/PROTOTYPE </h3>
            <p>After gathering feedback on the low-fidelity sketches, I proceeded to create a high-fidelity
                prototype using Figma. This prototype incorporated the necessary improvements and provided a
                more detailed representation of the final design. The high-fidelity prototype allowed for better
                visualization of the user interface and interactions, enabling further testing and refinement of
                the search function for the Ecoinvent database.</p>
