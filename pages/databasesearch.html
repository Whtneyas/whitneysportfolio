                <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
                <p>Ecoinvent is one of the most comprehensive databases for environmental and life cycle data. It’s
                    widely used by sustainability professionals, researchers, and policy makers. However, many users
                    reported that finding the right dataset within Ecoinvent was time-consuming and confusing. The
                    database’s interface lacked intuitive search options, clear filters, and contextual guidance, making
                    it difficult to compare or understand results.

                    As part of this project, I set out to redesign the user experience of dataset discovery — helping
                    users navigate complex data structures more efficiently and confidently.</p>

                <h2>ABOUT CLIENT</h2>
                <p>Ecochain is a company specialized in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) — a method used to measure the
                    environmental impact of a product throughout its entire life cycleEcochain offers two LCA
                    software
                    solutions: Ecochain Mobius and Ecochain Helix.
                    The main difference between the two lies in their target users and applications:

                    Ecochain Mobius promotes ecodesign and is designed for product designers with limited knowledge
                    of
                    LCA.
                    It enables them to easily create LCAs and make more sustainable design choices early in the
                    development
                    process.

                    Ecochain Helix empowers companies to create LCAs at scale for their production facilities. It
                    provides
                    insights into environmental impacts at the company, process, and product level, supporting
                    strategic
                    sustainability decisions.</p>

                <h2>CHALLENGE 🦾</h2>
                The existing search function of the Ecoinvent database has been one of the biggest challenges for
                Ecohain. Its complex and unintuitive method for finding datasets prevents users from fully benefiting
                from the platform. This raises the question: How might we improve the dataset discovery experience
                within the Ecoinvent database to help users find relevant datasets more efficiently and confidently?

                <h3>RESEARCH🔍</h3>
                <p>Before starting this project, I conducted extensive research to understand the current
                    experience, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement: </p>

                <h4>The various research conducted are </h4>

            <section>
                <h3>Expert review</h3>
                <p> To understand the current state of the product, I performed an exploratory product analysis
                    using a heuristic evaluation. This allowed me to identify initial usability issues and form
                    assumptions for further user research.

            <section>
                <h3>Best practices/Design patterns</h3>
                <p> Before I began designing, I conducted a best-practices analysis. I examined how other websites
                    implement filters and where these filters are positioned on the page. I also looked at how they
                    allow users to compare products. For this research, I primarily analysed e-commerce platforms
                    such as bol.com, MediaMarkt, Tweakers, Coolblue, Amazon, and around ten additional e-commerce
                    websites. I also reviewed relevant articles on optimising websites through filtering and the
                    differences between using filters versus a search bar on a website..
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Competitor research</h3>
                <p> To gain insight into how competitors use filters in their software, I conducted a competitive
                    analysis by examining similar software products. I researched the following competitors, and the
                    insights I gathered were applied in my low-fidelity sketches.

                <ul>
                    <li>Picklr</li>
                    <li>One Click LCA</li>
                    <li>Earthster</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>PROPOSED SOLUTION</h3>
                <p>The solution provides a more precise search system, improves the <b>ordering of search results</b>
                    through the use of <b>filters</b>, and enables users to <b>compare datasets</b>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>FLOW DIAGRAM</h3>
                <p>From the Mobius articles I read and the tutorials I watched, I identified a large number of
                    filters and visualised them in a flow diagram. I also examined the database to see which filters
                    are available and how they can be applied. I analysed this information by entering a product and
                    then reviewing the results. For example, when I entered “transport,” I saw several categories of
                    trucks, such as “small size,” “medium size,” and “large size.” Based on this, I concluded that
                    multiple types of trucks exist, and I incorporated this conclusion into a filter in the
                    system.Because of privacy reasons I am not állowed to show the flow diagram.

                <h3>LOW-FIDELITY & & ITERATIVE SKETCH ✏️</h3>
                <p>Based on the research conducted, I created low-fidelity sketches to visualize the concept of an
                    improved search function for the Ecoinvent database. These sketches served as a foundation for
                    further development and refinement of the design. </p>

                <figure>
                    <h4>Filter structure</h4>
                    <div class="filter-structures">

                        <div>
                            <h5>Iteration 1 - Filter on top</h5>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    The filter on top is based on the flow diagram i did. Placing the filters on top
                                    allows for easy access to all available filters at once.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    With this subfilter design, users can first select a main filter category, which
                                    then
                                    expands to reveal related subfilters. This approach helps to declutter the interface
                                    and helps users focus on specific criteria step by step.Making it easier to navigate
                                    through complex filtering options.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Filter with multiple subfilters allows users to refine their search criteria further
                                    by
                                    selecting multiple options within a single filter category. This design enhances the
                                    user experience by providing more granular control over search parameters.

                                This is the original layout of the datasets in the ecoinvent database. The layout is
                                cluttered and does not provide a clear overview of the datasets available. There is no
                                clear overview of the filters available to refine the search results.

                                it easier for users to scan through the options. Additionally, I incorporated visual
                                elements such as icons and color coding to enhance the overall user experience.

                <h3>HIFI-DELITY/PROTOTYPE </h3>
                <p>After gathering feedback on the low-fidelity sketches, I proceeded to create a high-fidelity
                    prototype using Figma. This prototype incorporated the necessary improvements and provided a
                    more detailed representation of the final design. The high-fidelity prototype allowed for better
                    visualization of the user interface and interactions, enabling further testing and refinement of
                    the search function for the Ecoinvent database.</p>
